<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>In the summer of 1849, I published certain conclusions at
which I have arrived with regard to Asiatic cholera, and the
facts and reasonings which had led to them. The following
is a very brief outline of these views. The cholera commences
as an affection of the alimentary canal, and not with
general illness; there is no evidence of poisoning of the
blood in this disease, except in some cases where secondary
fever occurs; there is conclusive evidence that cholera may
be communicated from person to person, and it follows,
therefore, that the morbid matter which produces the disease
is applied to the interior of the alimentary canal, where it
increases and multiplies during the period of so-called incubation,
and passes off, during the attack, to cause fresh cases
when suitable opportunities occur. Various circumstances
connected with the propagation of cholera seemed in accordance
with the above view of its pathology. Thus, it was
observed to pass frequently from person to person in the
crowded habitations of the poor, who eat, drink, cook, and
sleep in the same apartment, and pay little or no regard to
cleanliness, who live, in fact, under circumstances where the
sudden and copious evacuations of cholera, soiling the bed
and body linen, would not fail to contaminate the hands of
the patient and his attendants, and be thence transferred
to any food they might touch. The absence of colour and
odour in the evacuations could not help to favour this result.
The social visitor who came to see the poor patient,
or attend his funeral, frequently suffered, whilst the medical
man, and others who partook of no food in the apartment,
and who washed their hands when requisite, escaped. The
mining districts of this country have suffered excessively from
cholera in each epidemic, an event which might be explained
by the following circumstances when taken in connexion
with the above view of the cause of the disease. The miners
stay eight or nine hours at a time in the pits, and take food
with them, which they eat invariably with unwashed hands,
and without knife and fork, whilst the pits are without
privies, and are generally extremely foul and dirty. The
entire absence of daylight must also cause the workmen to
take much more dirt with their food than they are<a id='t1'></a> aware of. It
occurred to me, as soon as I began to entertain the above
opinions, that if the cholera excreta could reproduce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>disease in the way just mentioned, they might also do so
when diffused in water taken as drink, and that unless this
were the case, the whole of the phenomena of cholera, as an
epidemic, could not be explained. I, therefore, sought
anxiously, and waited patiently, for some confirmation of
this part of the subject before I should make my views
known. Two outbreaks of cholera occurred, however, about
the end of July 1849, one in Horsleydown, and the other in
the Wandsworth Road, which I investigated, and which
afforded what I considered conclusive evidence on the subject.
The water drank by the persons attacked in each of
these outbreaks had received, amongst other impurities, what
must have come from a patient previously ill of the disease.
I was able also to point out that the cholera was prevailing
most in those districts of the metropolis which received their
supply of water from certain parts of the Thames which contained
the sewage of the town, and, consequently, whatever
proceeded from the cholera patients. Before the end of
1849 I was able to show that a very close connexion existed
between the mortality from cholera and the nature of the
water supply, not only in London, but throughout the
country. This connexion was very evident in certain towns,
as Exeter and Hull, where the supply of water had been
changed between the epidemic of 1832 and that of 1849.
Where a polluted supply was changed for an unpolluted one,
the cholera was almost prevented; and where a scanty but
unpolluted supply had been changed for one contaminated
with the sewage of the town, the epidemic prevailed to a
fearful extent. The attention of Dr. Wm. Budd and Dr.
Farr was directed to this subject, with the result of confirming
what I had stated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Between the epidemics of 1849 and that of 1853, one of
the water companies supplying the south districts of London
changed its source of supply from the middle of the town,
near the foot of the Hungerford Suspension Bridge, to
Thames Ditton, at a part of the river which is beyond the
influence of the tide, and, therefore, out of reach of the
sewage of the metropolis. In the autumn of 1853 it was
shown by Dr. Farr<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that the districts partly supplied by this,
the Lambeth Water Company, with improved water, suffered
less than the districts supplied entirely by the Southwark
and Vauxhall Company with the water from the river at
Battersea Fields, although in 1849 they had suffered rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>more than the latter districts. By showing the water supply
in subdistricts, and thus getting a more correct line of
demarcation, I was able to point out<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c005'><sup>[2]</sup></a> that the advantage in
favour of the population partly supplied with the purer
water was even greater than Dr. Farr had indicated.</p>

<p class='c004'>I had learnt from the evidence of Mr. Quick in the
<i>Health of Towns Reports</i>, that the division of the houses, between
the Lambeth Company on the one hand, and the Southwark
and Vauxhall Company on the other, was not such as
obtains in the north districts of London, where a parish is
often divided between two water companies, but where one
company always leaves off at the point at which the other
begins. Throughout the greater part of Lambeth and Southwark,
the whole of Newington, and a part of Camberwell,
however, the supply of the two companies above mentioned
is actually intermixed, the pipes of both companies going
down the same streets, in consequence of the active competition
which once existed between three water companies,
two of which have since amalgamated and come to an agreement
with the other—the Lambeth company. Observing,
therefore, when the cholera returned in 1854, that there
was the same advantage in favour of the districts partly supplied
with water from Thames Ditton, I determined to make
an inquiry, the idea of which I had previously entertained.
It was obvious that, if the diminished mortality depended on
the improved supply of water, the benefit of the whole diminution
would be enjoyed by the inhabitants of houses having
this supply, whilst the population receiving impure water
would suffer as much as that of the districts which received
the same water, and no other. This point could be determined
by ascertaining the water supply of every house in
which a fatal attack of cholera might occur. After commencing
the inquiry I found that the circumstances were
calculated for affording even more conclusive evidence than
I had anticipated. The pipes of the two water companies
not only passed down all the streets, but into nearly all the
courts and alleys. A single house often had a different supply
from that on either side. Each water company supplied
alike both rich and poor, and thus there was a population of
300,000 persons, of various conditions and occupations, intimately
mixed together, and divided into two groups by no
other circumstance than the difference of water supply. One
group supplied with water contaminated, to a large extent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>with the sewage of London, and the other receiving a supply
altogether free from such impurity.</p>

<p class='c004'>I took great care to ascertain the nature of the water supply
correctly in every instance. I did not rest content with
the mere reply of the resident, or the appearance of the water,
without other evidence, such as the production of the receipt
for the water rate. I was also assisted very much by the
application of a chemical test to the water, for throughout
all the dry weather, which lasted whilst my inquiries were
being made, a mixture of sea water extended further up the
Thames than usual, and the water of the Southwark and
Vauxhall Company contained nearly forty grains of common
salt per gallon, whilst that of the Lambeth Company contained
only ·95 of a grain. These analyses were verified in
numerous cases where the source of the water could be
proved clearly by other evidence. For the first four weeks
of the epidemic I employed the list of deaths from cholera
published in the Weekly Returns of the Registrar-General,
and for the next three weeks, during which my inquiry extended,
I was kindly permitted to copy the addresses of persons
dying of cholera at the General Register Office. My
personal inquiry extended over every subdistrict to which
the supply of the Lambeth Water Company extended, and
it, therefore, included all the area in which the supply of
the two companies was intermixed in the manner explained
above.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time I was making my inquiry, the entire number
of houses supplied by each water company was known,
from a return made to Parliament, but the number of houses
supplied in each district and subdistrict by each company
respectively was not known. In order, therefore, to see the
exact bearing of my results, I found it desirable to extend
the inquiry over the districts supplied exclusively by the
Southwark and Vauxhall Company; for this purpose I
obtained the assistance of Mr. Whiting, a medical man, who
took great pains with his part of the inquiry, which was
merely to ascertain whether the houses in which fatal attacks
had taken place were supplied by the Southwark Company,
or from some other source, as a pump well or tidal ditch.
His inquiry extended over the first four weeks of the
epidemic.</p>

<p class='c004'>I gave a copy of the first results of my inquiry to Dr.
Farr, to whom I was indebted for facilities very kindly
afforded: and Dr. Farr being much struck with these results,
instituted a continuance of the inquiry through the district
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>registrars, who were requested to make a return of the supply
of water to each house in which a fatal attack of cholera
might occur in all the south districts of London. As the
registrars could not be expected to make a chemical analysis
of the water, or to seek out the landlord or agent in cases
where the tenant was not acquainted with the water supply,
the question remained unanswered in a considerable number
of instances, but the return was obtained for more than
three-fourths of the deaths, and shows, no doubt, the correct
proportion. Dr. Farr’s inquiry commenced from the 27th of
August, and extended to the close of the epidemic; and
as my inquiry extended to August 26th, the water supply
was obtained for the whole epidemic of 1854. It was
only necessary to make a computation of the small number
of attacks occurring in houses supplied by pump wells or
some other source, in the three weeks—the 5th to the 7th
inclusive—of the epidemic, in Bermondsey and the other
districts which do not receive the Lambeth water. This
computation was made according to the result ascertained in
the previous four weeks, and must approach very nearly to
the truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>In treating of the general results of this inquiry, it is desirable
to divide the epidemic into different periods, as the
influence of the water supply was found to diminish in relative
intensity as the epidemic progressed. In the first four weeks
of the epidemic of 1854, that is, from July 9th to August
5th inclusive, there were 334 deaths from cholera in the districts
to which the supply of the two water companies we
are considering extends. The water supply in every one of
these instances was made a matter of personal inquiry, and
the result of each case was published by me in detail in the
Appendix to a work on Cholera. In 286 instances the supply
of the house in which the attack took place was that of
the Southwark and Vauxhall Company; in 14 instances it
was that of the Lambeth Company; in 4 cases the supply
was from a pump well; in 26 cases the water was drawn
direct from the river, or a canal, or a tidal ditch; and in 4
cases the supply could not be ascertained, owing to the address
of the deceased persons, prior to the fatal attack, not
being known. The number of houses supplied by the Southwark
and Vauxhall Company was 40,046, having a population
estimated by the Registrar-General<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c005'><sup>[3]</sup></a> at 266,516, and
the number of houses supplied by the Lambeth Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>was 26,107, with an estimated population of 173,748; the
mortality from cholera was, therefore, at the rate of 107 to
each 100,000 inhabitants supplied by the former company,
and 8 to each 100,000 supplied by the latter; in other
words, the disease was between thirteen and fourteen times
as fatal to the population having the impure water as to that
having the improved supply. It is particularly worthy of
remark that, during the four weeks of the epidemic we are
now considering, there were but 563 deaths from cholera in
the whole metropolis, of which 286, or more than one-half,
occurred amongst the customers of the Southwark and Vauxhall
Company, who comprise a little more than one-tenth of
London, and a considerable number of the remaining deaths
took place amongst mariners, and others employed amongst
the shipping, who almost invariably draw their drinking water
directly from the river; it is, therefore, evident that at this
early period of the epidemic the impure water of the Thames
was almost the exclusive means of the propagation of the
malady.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the next three weeks of the epidemic there were 1,180
deaths from cholera in the districts supplied by the two
water companies. Of these, the fatal attack took place in
977 cases in houses supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall
Company; in 84 cases in houses supplied by the
Lambeth company; in 101 instances the supply was from
some other source; and in 18 cases it could not be ascertained,
for reasons previously stated. Taking into account
the population supplied respectively by each company, the
mortality was, at this period of the epidemic, nearly eight
times as great in that supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall
Company as in that supplied by the Lambeth Company.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the last ten weeks of the epidemic, from August
27th to November 4th inclusive, 3,564 deaths occurred in
the districts to which the supply of the two water companies
extends, and the returns of the district registrars showed
that in 2,443 cases the water supply of the house in which
the fatal attack took place was that of the Southwark and
Vauxhall Company; in 313 cases it was that of the Lambeth
Company; in 207 instances the supply was from pump
wells and other sources independent of the two water companies,
and in 601 instances the supply was not ascertained.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c005'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
These numbers show a mortality of 916 to each 100,000 inhabitants
supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and 180 to each 100,000 supplied by the Lambeth Company;
consequently, at this period of the epidemic, the mortality
was still more than five times as great amongst the population
supplied by the former company as amongst that supplied
by the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The results of my inquiry into the supply of water were,
of course, obtained separately for each district and subdistrict
in which the inquiry was made, and were so published; but
I was unable at the time to show the relation between the
supply of houses in which fatal attacks took place, and the
entire supply of each district and subdistrict, on account of
the latter circumstance not being known. I expressed myself
as follows in an article which I published soon after my
inquiry was made: “I hope shortly to learn the number of
houses in each subdistrict supplied by each of the water
companies respectively, when the effect of the impure water
in propagating cholera will be shown in a very striking
manner, and with great detail.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c005'><sup>[5]</sup></a> This information did not,
however, come within my reach till recently, and not even
then with all the accuracy I could desire. In the Report on
the Cholera Epidemics of London as affected by the Consumption
of Impure Water, lately written by Mr. Simon,
and published by the General Board of Health, there is a
statement of the number of houses supplied by each of the
water companies respectively in each district and subdistrict.
The line has not been very accurately drawn where a street,
as often happens, is partly in one district and partly in another;
and thus, in the recent Report, the subdistricts of St.
Saviour’s, Southwark, Leather Market, Bermondsey, Battersea,
and Peckham, have been represented to contain a few
houses supplied by the Lambeth Company, although they
do not contain any. With regard to Bermondsey, it is stated
in a foot note that some ends of streets may have been included
which have passed the registration boundary, and
this has happened in other cases; but the errors arising from
this cause are limited in amount, and cannot much affect the
statistical calculations that I have made. There is also a
further imperfection in the account of the water supply of
the subdistricts. The numbers which are stated to represent
the houses supplied by each water company in each
subdistrict are found on adding up the tables not to do so,
but to represent the number of houses, minus those situated
in streets in which no death occurred; the latter being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>placed all together at the end of each group of subdistricts
which constitutes a district. Streets vary in size from one
or two houses to two or three hundred, and the small streets
would obviously be the most likely to be exempt from mortality;
it could, therefore, do little good to distinguish such
streets; however, if thought desirable, this could as well have
been done by simply stating the number of the houses,
without deducting them from the gross number in each subdistrict.
The number of houses in these exempted streets is
about one-ninth of the whole. Instead of being able to compare,
as I could wish, the mortality in the houses supplied
by each company with the exact number of houses supplied,
I have only been able to compare it with the number of
houses in the streets in which deaths occurred. This will necessarily
raise the proportion of deaths about one-ninth; but
there is every reason to believe that the relative proportion
of deaths in the population supplied by the two companies
respectively, which is the real object of the inquiry, will remain
almost unaltered.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the first four weeks of the epidemic did not furnish a
sufficient number of cases in all the subdistricts to serve for
a statistical inquiry in detail, I have commenced by taking
the first seven weeks of the epidemic collectively; and the
first of the tables which accompanies this paper exhibits the
results of my personal inquiry, when placed in connexion
with the number of persons and houses supplied in each
subdistrict by each water company respectively.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c005'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
reader will observe from the last division of the table that
the proportion of deaths was, in every subdistrict, very much
greater amongst the population supplied by the Southwark
and Vauxhall Company than amongst that supplied by the
Lambeth Company, and that the relative mortality is nearly
the same throughout, except in two or three instances, where
there were but one or two deaths for the basis of calculation
amongst the customers of the Lambeth Company. The
second table shows the results of that part of the inquiry
conducted by Mr. Whiting, treated in a similar manner. In
the subdistricts here enumerated, which were supplied, except
just on the border of three of them, exclusively by the
Southwark and Vauxhall Company, the mortality will be
observed to be nearly the same, only a little higher, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>amongst the population supplied by the same company,
and mixed with that supplied by the Lambeth Company,
as shown in the previous table. In the third table the
figures contained in the two first are collected into a more
compact form, to show the result of the inquiry during the
first part of the epidemic, arranged in districts. The fourth
table contains the results of that part of the inquiry made by
Dr. Farr, when compared with the population supplied by
each water company respectively. It is necessarily
arranged in districts—for the results were so published in
the Weekly Returns<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c005'><sup>[7]</sup></a>—and not in subdistricts. The mortality
during the last ten weeks of the epidemic was greater
than during the first seven weeks, but the reader will observe
that a very great disproportion continues in every district
between the mortality of the population supplied by one
company and that supplied by the other. There is no district
to which the supply of both companies extends in which
the mortality is not more than three times as great amongst
the persons supplied by the Southwark Company as amongst
those supplied by the Lambeth Company, and the general
result shows a proportion of ninety-one to eighteen, or more
than five to one, as was stated before.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the fifth table the numbers in the previous ones are
added together, and fresh calculations made, so as to show
the result of the inquiry for the whole epidemic. The instances
in which the water supply was not specified, or not
ascertained, in the returns made by the district registrars
must evidently nearly all have been cases in which the house
was supplied by one or other of the water companies, for, if
the persons received no such supply, and obtained water
from a pump well, canal, or ditch, there could be no difficulty
in knowing the fact. Moreover, as the two water
companies are guided by precisely the same regulations, the
difficulty in ascertaining the supply is exactly the same
with regard to one as the other; I, therefore, concluded that
I could not be wrong in dividing the non-ascertained cases
between the two companies in the same proportion as those
which were ascertained, and I have done so at the foot of
table <span class='fss'>V</span>, in order to obtain a complete view of the influence
of the water supply during the whole epidemic of 1854.
These general results I have employed as the basis of some
further calculations.</p>

<p class='c004'>In table <span class='fss'>VI</span> I have copied from the Weekly Returns of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Registrar-General the mortality from cholera in every subdistrict
to which the supply of both, or either, of the water
companies extends. I have also calculated the number of
deaths which would have taken place in each subdistrict according
to the number of persons supplied with water by
each company respectively, and in accordance with the mortality
ascertained for the whole of the population supplied;
and it will be observed that the calculated mortality bears a
very close relation to the real mortality in each subdistrict.
This relation exists with regard both to the gross mortality
and to the mortality to each 10,000 living, all through the
table, and proves the overwhelming influence which the
nature of the water supply exerted over the mortality, overbearing
every other circumstance which could be expected
to affect the progress of the epidemic. Thus, in the crowded,
dirty, and very poor subdistricts of Lambeth Church, first
part, and Waterloo, first part, lying by the river side, the
mortality was low in consequence of the water supply being
chiefly that of the Lambeth Company; whilst in the thinly
peopled, and comparatively genteel subdistricts of Clapham
and Battersea the mortality was very high, in consequence
of the impure water of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company.
Taking this inquiry altogether, and considering that
the results which were published two years ago, and could
only be estimated collectively, are now corroborated in detail
through upwards of thirty subdistricts, it probably supplies
a greater amount of statistical evidence than was ever brought
to bear on a medical subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the latter part of 1854, the General Board of Health
procured from the two water companies, by order of the
Secretary of State, a list of all the houses which they supplied,
which lists are very valuable, as affording the means
of ascertaining the exact water supply of each district and
subdistrict separately. By direction of the Scientific Committee
of the Board of Health, the lists have been employed
in making a supplemental inquiry into the effect of the
water supply on cholera. For this purpose they were compared
with the lists of deaths at the General Registrar Office,
and the results have been embodied in the recent Report of
Mr. Simon, previously referred to. There are, however,
certain circumstances, which were probably unknown to the
Scientific Committee, and which render it impossible that an
inquiry, conducted in this manner, could do more than
approximate to the truth; and show why it can bear no comparison
in point of accuracy to a personal inquiry, made on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the spot, at the time of the epidemic. In the first place,
throughout the greater part of Lambeth, Newington, and
the Borough, the houses are either without numbers, or
numbered very irregularly, and the numbers are liable to
frequent change, as new houses are built, or older ones repainted;
there are also frequently repetitions of the same
number in the same street, and although, in some instances,
the companies have returned the names of the occupiers, that
can be of no assistance in the case of the poor, who occupy
but one or two rooms, and form the greater bulk of the
population. In the next place, the poor often furnish, unintentionally,
a wrong number to the registrar, even when the
houses are regularly numbered. They know their own
homes perfectly, but, having no occasion to refer to the
number, they partially forget it; and, in the greater number
of my personal inquiries, I had to call at two or three
houses before I found the one in which the death occurred.
For these reasons it follows that, in comparing the lists of the
water supply with the lists of deaths, many errors must have
occurred; and as the deaths were six times as numerous in
the houses supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company
as in those supplied by the Lambeth Company, the
evident result would be that out of every six mistakes five
would transfer a death from the former company to the latter,
and only one would transfer a death from the latter company
to the former. Another source of error, but operating
to a less extent, is, that a number of persons who were attacked
with cholera in houses supplied by the Southwark
Company died in the workhouses of St. Saviour’s, Lambeth,
and Newington, which were supplied by the Lambeth Company.
It need excite no surprise, therefore, that the supplemental
inquiry, embodied in the recent Report, instead of
showing a mortality of 160 and 27 for the population supplied
by the two water companies, or a difference of 6 to 1, showed
a mortality of 125 and 37 per 10,000, or a difference of only
3½ to 1. It must be obvious, however, independently of the
above facts, that a difference of three and a-half to one would
not explain the great difference in the mortality of the various
districts and subdistricts. The epidemic of 1853 is included
with that of 1854 in Mr. Simon’s Report; but as there were
but few deaths in 1853, and those chiefly amongst the population
supplied by the Southwark Company, this circumstance
would not much affect his results.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is probable that, when the facts brought to light by
this inquiry are sufficiently known, no one will deny the influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of impure water in promoting the mortality of cholera;
but it must not be supposed that it is mere impurity of an ordinary
kind that causes the disease, for there are innumerable
facts to prove that ordinary impurities have no such effect,
and that it is only when the specific morbid matter of the
disease gains access to the water that cholera is propagated.
Thousands of people drank water from their own neglected
cisterns, during the late epidemic, as impure as that of the
Southwark and Vauxhall Company, without ill effect. An
inquiry made by the vestry of St. James’, Westminster,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c005'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
proved that the contents of a cesspool had been percolating
for months through the three feet of earth which separated
it from the pump well in Broad Street; but although hundreds
of people were daily drinking the water, and cholera
was extending fearfully in many parts of London, only a
few scattered cases occurred in the streets near the pump till
the end of August, when, a case having happened amongst
the persons using the privy connected with the cesspool above
mentioned, more than five hundred persons were attacked
within two or three days.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the cases in which the cholera poison gains access to a
limited supply of drinking water, such as a tank or pumpwell,
the outbreak it occasions is always sudden, violent, and
limited; but when a river is the medium of the propagation
of the disease, its progress is more gradual and extended,
being diffused amongst the whole population using the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is hardly necessary to remark, that every circumstance
which proves the communication of cholera through the medium
of water, corroborates the views, explained at the
beginning of this paper, regarding its propagation in the
crowded houses of the poor; for it cannot be supposed that
a morbid matter, which can produce its specific effects after
being diffused and distributed through a quantity of water,
could fail to act in an undiluted state.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was my intention to make some remarks on the drainage
and water supply of towns, but this communication has
already exceeded the limits which I prescribed for it.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
